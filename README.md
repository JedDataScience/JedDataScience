## Joshua Detmer

I’m a student at the University of Virginia (UVA), double majoring in **Data Science** and **Applied Statistics**. I’m really interested in how data can be used to understand what’s happening in the real world by asking better questions and testing ideas the right way.

Outside of school, I’m big on anything outdoors. I love **hiking**, **skiing**, and pretty much anything that gets me outside and moving.

## What I’m interested in
A lot of my curiosity lives in the space between “data” and “decision-making.” I’m especially into:

- **Experimentation & A/B testing** 
- **Statistical data science** 
- **Inference + modeling/Dashboards** 
- **Clean data storytelling** 

I like projects where the point isn’t just making a graph or training a model. It’s more about answering a question with evidence. That usually means exploring patterns, validating them with statistical reasoning, and building a clean, repeatable workflow so the results are solid and easy to share.

## What you’ll find here
This GitHub is where I’ll be posting:
- **Classwork from UVA**
- **Personal projects** I build on my own time
- Practice work as I keep leveling up in Python, stats, and analytics

I’m always trying to improve how I write code and communicate results, so a lot of what’s here will be me learning in public and building better habits over time.

## Tools I use (and keep improving at)
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **R**
- **SQL**
- **Git/GitHub**
- Jupyter / VS Code
- Azure services
